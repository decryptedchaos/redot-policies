## Installation


Here's how to install clang-format:

- Linux: It will usually be available out-of-the-box with the clang toolchain
packaged by your distribution. If your distro version is not the required one,
you can download a pre-compiled version from the
`LLVM website <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`__, or if you are on
a Debian derivative, use the `upstream repos <https://apt.llvm.org/>`__.
- macOS and Windows: You can download precompiled binaries from the
`LLVM website <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`__. You may need to add
the path to the binary's folder to your system's ``PATH`` environment
variable to be able to call clang-format out of the box.

You then have different possibilities to apply clang-format to your changes:

## Manual usage

You can apply clang-format manually for one or more files with the following
```astro
    clang-format -i <path/to/file(s)>
```
- ``-i`` means that the changes should be written directly to the file (by
default clang-format would only output the fixed version to the terminal).
- The path can point to several files, either one after the other or using
wildcards like in a typical Unix shell. Be careful when globbing so that
you don't run clang-format on compiled objects (.o and .a files) that are
in Redot's tree. So better use ``core/*.{cpp,h}`` than ``core/*``.


## IDE plugin

Most IDEs or code editors have beautifier plugins that can be configured to run
clang-format automatically, for example, each time you save a file.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of beautifier plugins for some IDEs:

- Qt Creator: [Beautifier plugin](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html)
- Visual Studio Code: [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)
- Visual Studio: [Clang Power Tools 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=caphyon.ClangPowerTools2022)
- vim: [vim-clang-format](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-clang-format)
- CLion: Starting from version ``2019.1``, no plugin is required. Instead, enable
[ClangFormat](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/clangformat-as-alternative-formatter.html#clion-support)

(Pull requests are welcome to extend this list with tested plugins.)


## Header includes

When adding new C++ or Objective-C files or including new headers in existing
ones, the following rules should be followed:

- The first lines in the file should be Redot's copyright header and MIT
license, copy-pasted from another file. Make sure to adjust the filename.
- In a ``.h`` header, include guards should be used with the form
``FILENAME_H``.

- In a ``.cpp`` file (e.g. ``filename.cpp``), the first include should be the
one where the class is declared (e.g. ``#include "filename.h"``), followed by
an empty line for separation.
- Then come headers from Redot's own code base, included in alphabetical order
(enforced by ``clang-format``) with paths relative to the root folder. Those
includes should be done with quotes, e.g. ``#include "core/object.h"``. The
block of Redot header includes should then be followed by an empty line for
separation.
- Finally, third-party headers (either from ``thirdparty`` or from the system's
include paths) come next and should be included with the < and > symbols, e.g.
``#include <png.h>``. The block of third-party headers should also be followed
by an empty line for separation.
- Redot and third-party headers should be included in the file that requires
them, i.e. in the `.h` header if used in the declarative code or in the `.cpp`
if used only in the imperative code.
