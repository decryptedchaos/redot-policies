# Installation

Here's how to install ruff:

```astro
pip3 install ruff --user
```

You then have different possibilities to apply ruff to your changes:

## Manual usage

You can apply ``ruff`` manually to one or more files with the following
command:

```astro

ruff -l 120 <path/to/file(s)>
```

- ``-l 120`` means that the allowed number of characters per line is 120.
This number was agreed upon by the developers.
- The path can point to several files, either one after the other or using
wildcards like in a typical Unix shell.


Editor integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many IDEs or code editors have beautifier plugins that can be configured to run
ruff automatically, for example, each time you save a file. For details, you can
check `Ruff Integrations <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/>`__.

## Comment style guide

This comment style guide applies to all programming languages used within
Godot's codebase.

- Begin comments with a space character to distinguish them from disabled code.
- Use sentence case for comments. Begin comments with an uppercase character and
always end them with a period.
- Reference variable/function names and values using backticks.
- Wrap comments to ~100 characters.
- You can use ``TODO:``, ``FIXME:``, ``NOTE:``, ``WARNING:``, or ``HACK:`` as admonitions
when needed.

**Example:**

```

    // Compute the first 10,000 decimals of Pi.
    // FIXME: Don't crash when computing the 1,337th decimal due to `increment`
    //        being negative.
```

Don't repeat what the code says in a comment. Explain the *why* rather than *how*.

**Bad:**

```

    // Draw loading screen.
    draw_load_screen();
```

You can use Javadoc-style comments above function or macro definitions. It's
recommended to use Javadoc-style comments *only* for methods which are not
exposed to scripting. This is because exposed methods should be documented in
the :ref:`class reference XML <doc_updating_the_class_reference>`
instead.

**Example:**

```
    /**
     * Returns the number of nodes in the universe.
     * This can potentially be a very large number, hence the 64-bit return type.
     */
    uint64_t Universe::get_node_count() {
        // ...
    }
```
For member variables, don't use Javadoc-style comments, but use single-line comments instead:

```
    class Universe {
        // The cached number of nodes in the universe.
        // This value may not always be up-to-date with the current number of nodes
        // in the universe.
        uint64_t node_count_cached = 0;
    };
```
