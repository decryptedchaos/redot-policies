# Our Mission:
Redot is more than a fork of the Godot engine. We are a collaborative, open-source community that welcomes developers of all skill levels.

**Our mission is to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge-sharing, empowering every member to grow and contribute as we push the boundaries of what an open-source community can achieve.**
