title: "Roles & Structure"

# Overview
The development team is organized into several core roles to ensure focus, expertise, and efficiency in each stage of the development process. This structure provides a foundation for collaboration and growth across specialized areas, each contributing unique skills towards the project's shared goals.
Alongside these core roles, specialized sub-teams, such as **UI/UX**, **Scripting**, **Networking**, and **Core Development**, may be formed as necessary. These sub-teams enable members to concentrate on their strengths and handle specific aspects of the project with a high level of expertise.
This flexible structure allows the team to adapt as project requirements evolve, with sub-teams created or restructured as needed to respond to new challenges and areas requiring focused attention. Collaboration between these groups ensures that each part of the project benefits from specialized knowledge while maintaining alignment with the overall project vision.
By organizing into core roles and specialized teams, we support both individual growth and cohesive, efficient teamwork, helping the team to meet project milestones and deliver high-quality results.

# Roles and Responsibilities

## Manager
The  Manager role is assigned to select senior developers as an extension of their responsibilities. Individuals in this role possess an in-depth understanding of all Redot policies and procedures, along with a proven track record demonstrating their ability to apply and uphold these standards.  Managers serve as key resources in ensuring that policies are followed correctly, continuously enhancing the development process, and bridging the gap between technical and non-technical individuals.

### Responsibilities
* Collaborate with the development team to refine policies and procedures, improving the development process as needed.
* Ensure that procedures are properly executed and that all team members adhere to established policies.
* Act as a liaison between technical aspects of development and the community’s non-technical individuals, effectively communicating complex concepts.
* Guide development team members on the correct application of Redot's policies and procedures and address questions or concerns as they arise.


## QA
The  QA role is designated for individuals dedicated to testing engine changes and identifying bugs or unintended behaviors before they reach the community.  QA members play a crucial role in maintaining quality standards and ensuring a smooth user experience by catching issues early in the development process.

### Responsibilities
* Follow the established issue-reporting process to effectively communicate bugs and unintended behaviors to developers.
* Conduct hands-on testing of new features and unreleased changes to the engine to ensure functionality and stability.
* Collaborate closely with the development team to address and resolve issues discovered during testing.
* Partner with  Managers to continually refine and enhance testing procedures for improved efficiency and accuracy.

## Developers
Developers are the driving force of the project, responsible for implementing features and addressing issues raised by the community. They follow Redot’s policies and procedures to ensure effective communication and a streamlined development process. Developers work collaboratively, continually enhancing their individual skills and growing as a cohesive team.

### Sr. Developer
Senior Developers are among the most experienced members of the development team. They bring a deep understanding of the development process, strong leadership abilities, and a commitment to helping others succeed.

#### Responsibilities
* Lead and manage smaller teams of developers within their area of expertise.
* Review and approve changes and pull requests on GitHub, ensuring code quality and adherence to standards.
* Review and accept community proposals and ensure that maintain appropriate labeling.
* Ensure pull requests have been assigned to the appropriate milestone and that the roadmap is being updated appropriately.
* Ensure that team members are following Redot’s policies and maintaining best practices.
* Provide constructive feedback and collaborate with  Managers to refine and improve development procedures.
* Evaluate team members’ strengths and assign them to areas where they can have the greatest impact.
* Work closely with their teams to address complex issues, developing effective strategies for resolution.

### Core Developer
Core Developers focus on the essential components and foundational systems of the project, ensuring that the underlying architecture and main functionalities remain robust and efficient. They often tackle technically challenging tasks that require a deep understanding of the project’s core structures.

#### Responsibilities
* Implement and maintain key systems and features, ensuring high standards of performance and reliability.
* Collaborate with other developers to integrate new features into the core engine effectively.
* Document the core systems and contribute to knowledge-sharing resources for other team members.
* Work with Sr. Developers and  Managers to identify potential improvements to the engine's core architecture.
* Ensure GitHub issues and community proposals are tagged appropriately.

### Jr. Developer
Junior Developers are newer members of the team who are actively developing their skills and gaining experience. They contribute to project tasks under the guidance of more experienced developers and often handle entry-level responsibilities.

#### Responsibilities
* Implement features and fixes as assigned, following Redot’s development guidelines and best practices.
* Collaborate with other developers to learn and apply new techniques and processes.
* Assist in testing and debugging code, providing support for minor issues.
* Actively seek feedback from Sr. Developers and Core Developers to improve their skills and understanding of the development process.
