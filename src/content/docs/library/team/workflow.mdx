# Overview

<span></span>
### Bug Report Workflow
1. A bug report is opened as an issue on GitHub.
2. A Core Developer or Senior Developer reviews the issue and applies relevant labels.
3. A corresponding forum post is created on Discord, with labels matching those on the GitHub issue, to centralize discussion.
4. Relevant teams are notified to review the bug report, contribute insights, and engage in the discussion on Discord.
5. Senior Developers assess the issue, assign a priority level, and add the GitHub issue to the appropriate milestone.
6. Based on priority, the task is assigned to:
     1. **The Senior Developer** themself,
     2. **Core Developers**,
     3. **Junior Developers** (with a Core Developer as a mentor), or
     4. Left open for community contribution.
7. Once the issue is taken on, the assigned developer(s) open a draft pull request, marking the issue as "in progress" and allowing for ongoing review of the implementation.
8. After completing and testing the fix locally, the developer(s) update the pull request, mark it as open, and request an initial review.
9. The assigned Senior Developer reviews the implementation, suggesting changes as needed and marking the pull request as "ready for testing" once the changes are satisfactory.
10. A QA team member picks up the pull request, verifies that all testing procedures pass successfully, and leaves a report.
11. Implementers make any additional changes based on QA feedback, with reviews from the Senior Developer until no further issues are reported by QA.
12. A second Senior Developer performs a final review before approving the merge.
13. The Senior Developer overseeing the pull request completes the merge and then closes both the linked GitHub issue and the associated Discord forum thread.

### Proposal Workflow
1. Proposals are reviewed and judged based on the Proposal Acceptance Guidelines
2. The accepted proposal is opened as an issue on GitHub.
3. A Core Developer or Senior Developer reviews the issue and applies relevant labels.
4. A corresponding forum post is created on Discord, with labels matching those on the GitHub issue, to centralize discussion.
5. Relevant teams are notified to review the proposal, contribute insights, and engage in the discussion on Discord.
6. Senior Developers assess the proposal and add the GitHub issue to the appropriate milestone.
7. A discussion is held to determine whether the development team will take on the feature implementation or if it will be left to community contribution.
8. If it's decided that the community will implement the feature the GitHub issue will be marked as "implementer needed". Otherwise, the Senior Developers of the relevant teams will discuss the best course of action and who should be assigned to the task.
9. Based on complexity, the task is assigned to:
        1. **The Senior Developer** themself
        2. **Core Developers**, or
        3. **Junior Developers** (with a Core Developer as a mentor)
10. Once the issue is taken on, the assigned developer(s) open a draft pull request, marking the issue as "in progress" and allowing for ongoing review of the implementation.
8. After completing and testing the feature locally, the developer(s) update the pull request, mark it as open, and request an initial review.
9. The assigned Senior Developer reviews the implementation, suggesting changes as needed and marking the pull request as "ready for testing" once the changes are satisfactory.
10. A QA team member picks up the pull request, verifies that all testing procedures pass successfully, and leaves a report.
11. Implementers make any additional changes based on QA feedback, with reviews from the Senior Developer until no further issues are reported by QA.
12. A second and third Senior Developer performs a final review before approving the merge.
13. The Senior Developer overseeing the pull request completes the merge and then closes both the linked GitHub issue and the associated Discord forum thread.

These workflows ensure thorough review, testing, and collaboration across all relevant teams, resulting in high-quality bug resolutions, feature introductions, and effective communication throughout the process.

# Collaboration Through Communication
Effective communication is essential for a development team to function smoothly. Redot utilizes its community Discord server as a central communication hub, enabling developers to exchange ideas and collaborate through text, voice, and forum channels. This centralized platform, with its variety of communication options, supports seamless coordination among team members across different time zones.

In addition to Discord, GitHub serves as the primary tool for direct communication regarding code reviews, as well as for tracking issues and pull requests within the repository. By keeping discussions organized and focused, we ensure that relevant information is easy to locate and the message history remains clear. Professional conduct and a clear separation between on-topic discussions and casual conversations are essential to maintain a productive and accessible communication environment.
