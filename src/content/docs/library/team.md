# Purpose
This document provides a high-level overview of the development team's structure, roles, and primary functions. Its goal is to clarify each role’s purpose, expected responsibilities, and how each team member contributes to the development lifecycle.

Having a well-defined structure helps ensure:
- **Clear Role Definition**: Each team member understands their responsibilities and how they contribute to project goals.
- **Efficient Collaboration**: By outlining team roles, we create a foundation for effective collaboration and communication.
- **Aligned Objectives**: The document aligns team members with the project’s goals, setting clear boundaries and separation of duties between roles.
- **Continuous Improvement**: By defining roles and workflows, the team can regularly assess and improve its collaboration, efficiency, and outcomes.

This document complements existing workflow guides and communication protocols, providing a foundational understanding of team roles for both current and new members of the development team. As the team scales or adjusts to meet project needs, this overview will evolve to reflect new roles, updated responsibilities, and improved processes, fostering an adaptive and resilient development environment.

> This overview serves as a reference for team members, new developers, and community members to understand the operational framework of the development team.
