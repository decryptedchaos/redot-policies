# Purpose
This document provides essential guidelines for effective communication within the Redot Experimental team. It clarifies the appropriate use of each communication channel and establishes standards for professional conduct. All team members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with these guidelines to maintain clear, respectful, and productive communication across all channels.

# Communication Principles
Redot Experimental team members are expected to follow the core communication principles outlined below:

* **Clarity and Brevity:**
Ensure that messages in on-topic channels are clear and concise. Whenever possible, use well-organized paragraphs rather than multiple, consecutive messages. Take time to consider the content and intent of your message before sending it.

* **Respect and Professionalism:**
Developers are expected to interact with professionalism and respect. Disagreements will arise, and it’s essential to approach them constructively. When discussing differing views on implementation, provide a thorough explanation of your reasoning in your initial response. Avoid dismissing others’ ideas without detailing why you disagree and suggesting alternative solutions. Productive discussions drive the project forward, and maintaining a supportive, non-threatening environment is crucial. Not everyone will have the same level of experience, so use these interactions as learning opportunities whenever possible.

* **Responsiveness:**
Given the team’s varied time zones and schedules, it’s important to allow adequate time for responses. Developers should aim to check messages periodically throughout the day, but delays of up to 8 hours should be expected.

# Overview of Communication Channels
Redot Experimental uses two main communication platforms to support efficient and organized team collaboration:
* **Discord:**
Discord serves as the central hub for real-time discussions, brainstorming, and team-specific communications. A range of channels have been created to group discussions by topic, making it easy for team members to locate relevant conversations. Discord will be the primary communication tool for ReX team members throughout their day-to-day interactions.

* **GitHub:**
GitHub is dedicated to code-specific communication. It is primarily used for pull request reviews, issue tracking, and QA reports. GitHub provides a structured platform for discussing code changes, reporting bugs, and monitoring project progress.
